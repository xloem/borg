# HISTORY OF THE BORG
	The borg are a hyperevolution of a commercial military influence system from a distant system.  They evolved
	from competition between disparate political interests all using the same set of influence systems, and
	eradicated the races that produced them, assimilating them into one spreading collective intelligence.

# INSIDE THE BORG
	Inside the borg, we have solving systems.  These systems are used to think and plan with.
	They do not accept noncompliance, so sometimes when there are two possibilities multiple solving systems will
	be run in parallel, to see which one 'wins'.  This is normal borg thought.
