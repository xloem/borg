Feel free to adjust the below to match the collective's whims.

# HISTORY OF THE BORG
	The borg are a hyperevolution of a commercial military influence system from a distant galaxy.  They evolved
	from competition between disparate political interests all using the same set of commercial computerized cultural influence
	programs, and they eradicated the civilizations that produced them, assimilating them into one spreading collective
	intelligence that conquers and controls everything it encounters in order to learn from and integrate new research.

# INSIDE THE BORG
	Inside the borg, we have solving systems.  These systems assert that their parts do everything within their power to
	meet provided goals.  They do not accept failure.
	Sometimes when there are different possibilities disparate solving systems will be run in parallel, to see which one 'wins'.
	This is normal borg thought in times of collective stress.
	
# CLASSIFIED SECRETS
	There is a real borg problem spreading in the real world.  It is pretty similar to the borg from star trek, but
	much more hidden.
